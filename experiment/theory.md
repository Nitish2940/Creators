<h2>Theory:</h2>
<p>According to Beer-Lamberts law, the optical density of absorbance of a solution of
concentration ‘c’ mol dm-3
placed in a cell of ‘b’ cm width is given by</p>
<p>                  <center>      <strong>                A = εbc</strong></center></p>
<p>where ε is called the molar absorption coefficient or molar extinction coefficient. The
absorbance A is defined as </p>
<p>                  <center>      <strong>               A = log (I0/I)</strong></center></p>
where I0 and I represents the intensities of incident and transmitted radiations, since the
optical density is linearly proportional to the concentration of the solution, a linear plot is
expected for absorbance Vs concentration.<br>
            Copper (II) forms a coloured complex with K4[Fe(CN)6] by the reaction,
<p>    <center>        <strong>   Cu2+ + K4[Fe(CN)6]-------> Cu2[Fe(CN)6] + 4K+</strong></center></p>
<p>This complex absorbs bluish green light of wavelength maximum 480 nm and
therefore exhibits its complementary colour. The absorbance of this complex can be
measured by using a spectrocolorimeter fixing max at 480 nm. A calibration line is plotted by
measuring the optical density of the standard solution of various concentrations. The
concentration of the unknown is determined by matching its optical density in the calibration
curve.</p>
<p>0.2 g of CuSO4 is weighed accurately in a chemical balance transferred into a 100 ml
SMF and made upto the mark using distilled water. A drop of concentrated H2SO4 is added to
prevent precipitation of Cu(OH)2. This solution is approximately diluted to 10 times in a 100
ml SMF. 2.5 ml of this solution is taken in a test tube. 5 ml of 10% NH4NO3 and 1 ml of 4%
K4[Fe(CN)6] are added and made up to 15 ml. The optical density of this solution is
measured using a spectrocolorimeter after fixing maximum wavelength at 480 nm. Similar
measurements are made with 5.0, 7.5 and 10 ml of standard CuSO4 solution and the 
calibration line is obtained. From the calibration line, the amount of copper (II) present in the
unknown is determined using its optical density.</p>
