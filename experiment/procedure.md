<p><b>Procedure</b></p>
<p>1. Start the simulator by clicking on the green arrow, which is provided in the right corner at bottom of simulator.<br>
2. Click on the beaker of CuSO4 to add and pour it into conical flask.<br>
3. Then add 40ml water in the flask after that add few drops of conc.H2SO4 in that conical flask.<br>
4. Click on the green arrow to proceed further step.<br>
5. Take the solution with dropper and add it into test tube.<br>
6. After that add K4Fe(CN)6 and NH4NO3 in test tube.<br>
7. click on the arrow for next step.<br>
8. Turn on the spectrocolorimeter by clicking on the "power on" button which turn the white light into red.<br>
9. Place the test tube in the spectrocolorimeter by draging the test tube to the spectrocolorimeter.<br>
10. Set the wavelength by clicking on the "set wavelength" button.<br>
11. Spectrocolorimeter will show the reading which is optical density.<br>
12. Note the reading.<br>
13. Click on the arrow to proceed next step.<br>
14. Again take the different concentration in dropper and add it to test tube.<br>
15. After that add K4Fe(CN)6 and NH4NO3 in test tube.<br>
16. Follow same procedure in  spectrocolorimeter.<br>
17. Note the second reading.<br>
18. Similarly, note the third and fourth reading.<br>
19. After fourth reading click on arrow to get<strong> Observation table</strong>.<br>
20. Fill the readings of optical density  in observation table.<br>
21. Click on calculate to get the amout of copper present in solution.<br>
22. Click on "plot graph" to get calibrated graph.</p>
