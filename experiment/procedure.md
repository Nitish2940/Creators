<p><b>Procedure</b></p>
<p>Start the simulator by clicking on the green arrow, which is provided in the right corner at bottom of simulator.<br>
Click on the beaker of CuSO4 to add and pour it into conical flask.<br>
then add 40ml water in the flask after that add few drops of conc.H2SO4 in that conical flask.<br>
Click on the green arrow to proceed further step.<br>
Take the solution with dropper and add it into test tube.<br>
After that add K4Fe(CN)6 and NH4NO3 in test tube.<br>
click on the arrow for next step.<br>
Turn on the spectrocolorimeter by clicking on the "power on" button which turn the white light into red.<br>
Place the test tube in the spectrocolorimeter by draging the test tube to the spectrocolorimeter.<br>
Set the wavelength by clicking on the "set wavelength" button.<br>
Spectrocolorimeter will show the reading which is optical density.<br>
Note the reading.<br>
Click on the arrow to proceed next step.<br>
Again take the different concentration in dropper and add it to test tube.<br>
After that add K4Fe(CN)6 and NH4NO3 in test tube.<br>
Follow same procedure in  spectrocolorimeter.<br>
Note the second reading.<br>
Similarly, note the third and fourth reading.<br>
After fourth reading click on arrow to get<strong> Observation table</strong>.<br>
Fill the readings of optical density  in observation table.<br>
Click on calculate to get the amout of copper present in solution.<br>
Click on "plot graph" to get calibrated graph.</p>
