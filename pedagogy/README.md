#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Students will be able to identify the apparatus and reagents  being used in the experiment. | Student has to select the  required apperatus and  reagents from the list display by the simulator. | Select all the apperatus and reagents required for the experiment ? 
2.| Students will be able to describe  the "preparation of sample" for the experiment. | Student has to prepare the sample using reagents. | Which reagent is added very first to the sample?.
3.| Students will be able to Apply the experimental conditions by placing sample and setting maximum wavelength in spectro calorimeter. | Student has to place the sample and set the maximum wavelength in spectrocolorimeter. | What  is the maximum wavelenght at which experiment is being performed? <br> A 350nm <br> B 450nm <br> C 480nm <br> D. none of the above  <br>
4.| Student will able to perform experiment and record the reading for further calculation| Student will use the spectrocolorimeter and record the reading.  |  What is the mean of the optical densities of all the samples ? <br> A. 0.2g <br> B. 0.32g <br> C. 0.5g <br>  D. 1.0g  <br>
5.| Students will be able to sketch the calibration graph. | Student has to press the "plot graph" button . |  Is the plotted graph is straight line? (Yes/No).
6.| Students will be able to determine the concentration of copper in water sample. | Student has to press on "show result" button. | what is the permissible limit of copper for drinking water ? <br> A. 0.2 ppm <br> B. 3.2 ppm <br> C. 1.3 ppm <br>  D. 4.0 ppm </b> <br>.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student has to select the  required apperatus and  reagents which is display by the simulator| Simulator will display apperatus, reagents  and give instruction " select the apperatus and reagents required for the experiment".| To make user remember the requisites of the experimetent.
2.| Student will be able to describe  the "preparation of sample" for the experiment | Simulator will display selected apperatus and reagents and display instruction to mis reagents for sample sample preperation| To make student used to with the sample preperation.
3.| Student has to set maximum wavelenght at which experiment is being performed and place the sample in spectrocolorimeter |Simulator will popup istruction to set wavelength and place sample in spectrocolorimeter| To make student known with the maximum wavelength on which experiment is performed.
4.| Student will use the spectrocolorimeter and record the reading. | Simulator will allow the student to record the reading| To make the student accustemed in recording the reading.
5.| Student has to press the "plot graph" button and give the answer of the question | Simulator will display "plot graph" button and  popup the question "is the plotted graph is straight line?" (Yes/No).| To check whether the plotted graph is correct .
6.| Student has to press on "show result" button and answer the question |Simulator will display "show result" button and popup the question "what is the permissible limit of copper for drinking water ?" <br> A. 0.2 ppm <br> B. 3.2 ppm <br> C. 1.3 ppm <br>  D. 4.0 ppm | To make the Students well known with the permissible limit of copper for drinking water. </b> <br>.
