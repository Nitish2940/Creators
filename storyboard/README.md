<p><strong>Round 2- Development of virtual lab</strong>
<p>1. Story outline<br>
This experiment is about finding the concentration of copper by the method of spectrocolorimetry. It involves preparation  of  reagent in fixed proportion by pouring 0.2 g of CuSO4 is weighed accurately in a chemical balance transferred into a 100 ml SMF and made upto the mark using distilled water. A drop of concentrated H2SO4 is added to prevent precipitation of Cu(OH)2. This solution is approximately diluted to 10 times in a 100 ml SMF. 1 ml of this solution is taken in a test tube. 5 ml of 10% NH4NO3 and 1 ml of 4% K4[Fe(CN)6] are added and made up to 15 ml. The optical density of this solution is measured using a spectrocolorimeter after fixing maximum wavelength at 480 nm. Similar measurements are made with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 ml of standard CuSO4 solution and the 8 calibration line is obtained. From the calibration line, the amount of copper (II) present in the unknown is determined using its optical density and through the readings we plot the graph between absorbance vs concentration.</p>
