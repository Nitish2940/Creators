Round 2:
**1. Story outline**

This experiment is about determining copper concentration in a given water. It involves preparing solution by adding 0.2 g of CuSO4 into a 100 ml SMF and made upto the mark using distilled water. A drop of concentrated H2SO4 is added to prevent precipitation of Cu(OH)2. This solution is approximately diluted to 10 times in a 100 ml SMF. 2.5 ml of this solution is taken in a test tube. 5 ml of 10% NH4NO3 and 1 ml of 4% K4[Fe(CN)6] are added and made up to 15 ml. The optical density of this solution is measured using a spectrocolorimeter after fixing maximum wavelength at 480 nm. Similar measurements are made with 5.0, 7.5 and 10 ml of standard CuSO4 solution and the calibration line is obtained. From the calibration line, the amount of copper (II) present in the unknown is determined using its optical density.

  **2.5 Allow pitfalls:**
  1. User has to select 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10ml of sample for measuring optical densities, if  selection is wrong or any volume has missed by user then graph will not be straight line. So instruction has given at wrong selection to correct it at the moment.

2. If user enter wrong reading or changes sequence in which reading has been taken then graph will change and instruction will popup to correct the reading

This pitfall does not mean wrong answer and retrying . It is designed to clear misconceptions or incorrect knowledge .<br>
**2.5 Conclusion**

The time required to recall the apparatus & reagents and understand the procedure of the experiment is 5-7 minutes. It will take another 5 min to standard solution. Data recording will take 5 min. filling reading of optical densities in the table and plotting calibrated graph will take 3-5min. , result and assessment question will also take 5 min. Hence total time in performing the experiment will be almost 30 min.<br>
**2.6 Equations/Formulas**

**A.** Equation will be used for the calculation of:

**a)**  concentration of copper = Test OD/Std OD * Std Concentration
